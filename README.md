# portfolio

Static site source code for my portfolio (circa 2018). The (master) branch is
source code; (gh-page) branch contains generated files that are displayed on my
domain. The latter is automatically generated by running "hexo deploy".

Uses hexo.

# plugins installed

hexo init

npm install -g hexagon-cli
%% https://github.com/adamsiwiec/hexagon
% The only use for this seems to be listing installed plugins... it can't remove packages

hexa -p hexo-filter-pathfix
%% https://github.com/wayou/hexo-filter-pathfix
% does not seem to work?

sudo npm uninstall hexo-filter-pathfix
sudo npm uninstall hexo-asset-path

%% https://github.com/r12f/hexo-asset-path
%  npm install hexo-asset-path --save

%% https://github.com/wayou/hexo-filter-pathfix
% UGH has to be of layout type "post"

% hexa -t next 
% install "Next" hexo theme


%% https://hexo.io/api/filter.html#Execute-Filters
npm install --save hexo-featured-image

%% https://github.com/quincyyhuang/hexo-node-admin

npm install hexo-deployer-git --save

well... moving on for now...
git clone https://github.com/theme-next/hexo-theme-next themes/next


# Notes

- Excerpt should not contain images above the "<!--more-->" line. These images
  will not render properly in the index view, due to relative path & asset
  folder issues
- Using hexo-node-admin as editor  --> set this up inside the root folder
  (/portfolio)
- initial setup of deploying: $ git checkout -b gh-pages; $ git push
  --set-upstream origin gh-pages

# Quickstart

cd portfolio
hexo clean; hexo gen -w
hexo s --debug -p 4000
hexo new "A Project"

cd portfolio/hexo-node-admin
npm start
localhost:9000 --> edit pages (set featured image, blurb, exercept, full post, etc.)

cd portfolio
hexo deploy


# Todo
+ install indigo next theme
+ make featured image appear in "archive" view
+ make homepage not the blog
+ make grid on homepage
+ make featured image appear in categories or tags page
- deploy on nfs server, so that I can use the hexo-node-admin editor online &
  not need a terminal to deploy changes (run hexo generate)

# New project

hexo new "A Project"
Set blurb and featured_image in the frontmatter

# Scratch
