## About me
For fun, here's some more about me: 

My main hobby at the moment is sailing. I hope to sail across the Atlantic Ocean
as crew before I graduate, and as skipper sometime in the future after that.

This is me making a rudder & dealing with epoxy fumes (I wasn't safe :/ and had
a rash from expoxy exposure on my arms for 2 or 3 very itchy weeks. PSA #1 don't
be dumb PSA #2 go see urgent care).
