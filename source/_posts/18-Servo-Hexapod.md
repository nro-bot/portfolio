*Fall 2011*


Inspired by videos of dancing hexapod competitions, I built an 18-servo hexapod and programmed it by myself. It was made of ABS plastic, 18 servos, an Arduino nano, and a Pololu serial servo controller. With Prof. Dan Frey's permission, I substited this independent project for the normal coursework for Design and Manufacturing I. The hexapod used the tripod gait to walk and turn around.

**What I did**: This project was my own design, fabrication, and programming.

I wrote an Instructables about it which was featured and received over 44,000 views: [Simple 18dof Hexapod, Arduino nano (optionally with pololu maestro)](http://www.instructables.com/id/Simple-18dof-Hexapod-Arduino-nano-optionally-wit/).

The code may be found on [Github](https://github.com/nouyang/18-servo-hexapod).
