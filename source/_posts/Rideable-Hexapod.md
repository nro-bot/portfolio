Over the summer of 2011, I welded and wired together a rideable hexapod based on designs by Rick Pantaleo. Itâ€™s built with a steel tubing frame (MIG welded), controlled by two drill trigger controllers, a found racing car seat, and powered by donated A123 lead acid replacement batteries with reused tennis balls for feet. I took it to two New York Maker Faires and let kids ride in it.
