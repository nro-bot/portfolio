What: Small vending machine to stock Arduinos in our makerspace.
Who: Lathe spring-making technique from Instructables, all else by me.
Details: Four servos and springs, push buttons, arduino. Lasercut wood frame. To be decided: work with expensive cash reader, use honor/MIT ID, or leave next to computer and use Square?

What: Final project, 6.163 Power Electronics, to drive rideable hexapod's motors.
Who: Based heavily off of designs documented by Charles Guan and Shane Colton.
Details: Main signal board and two daughter power boards. Attiny44, IR21844 driver chip.

source files: < github.com/nouyang/hexapodtroller >


Who: I adapted existing attiny25/85  charlieplexed LED circuitry/code to the attiny45. Yoyo model from friend Laura Shumaker.
Details: 6 charlieplexed LEDs on 3 pins on an Attiny45, leaving pins for a button (on/off) and a phototransistor (for receiving new images to display). Intended to be press-fit into a (here 3d-printed) yoyo body with a depressible thermoformed cover and a coin-cell battery.




What: Silicone food mold.
Who: Design based on internet meme. CAD + Partworks CAM by me.
For: How to Make Almost Anything.
Details: Insulation foam positive CNC milled on Shopbot. Negative mold cured from two-part silicone mix.
 


What: HackNY Hackathon entry.
Who: Charlie He, Nathan Hwang, David Iserovich, and I.
For: Silliness.
Details: Nyancat floats over google maps, replaces nouns in the nytimes news ticker with parse.ly, etc. Won "Most APIs" award.
 

What: Hexapod prototypes designed by UC Berkeley Biomimetic MIllisystems.
Who: Katy Gero organized this building session (I led the group).
For: Fun. Voluntary reading group with food funded by MIT's American Society of Mechanical Engineers chapter. 
Details: Lasercut bristol board, elmer's glue, super glue. Manual actuation.

What: Laser-etched poptart.
Who: Derivative work of lvl1 hackerspace. Independent processing for lasercutting. 
For: Fun.

Left: As president of the student-run shop MITERS, I organized a series of peer-to-peer workshops from scratch (topics included 555 LEDs, Eagle, surface-mount soldering).
 
 What: Rideable linkage-mechanism hexapod
Who: Derivative of Rick Pantaleo's Instructables, with custom controls. Built entirely by myself.
For: For fun! Plus, kids enjoy riding it.
Details: Steel tubing frame (MIG welded), two wheelchair motors directly controlled by two drill trigger controllers, racing car seat (found), powered by A123 lead acid replacement (donated), tennis ball feet (donated).
 
 
Started and led reading group with over twenty people to discuss and read papers on engineering softwar5e that aids in design, simulation, and analysis.
