I’m an engineer, entrepreneur, and a roboticist (whoo robots!). I’m currently pursuing a PhD in computer science at Harvard. Previously, I studied mechanical engineering from MIT, graduating in 2013. Featured Projects ICRA Paper: Six-axis Force-Torque Sensor Paper on new design for a six-axis force-torque sensor, based on a webcam tracking fiducial tags. Accepted to ICRA 2020. Motivated by the expense and fragility of commercial sensors such as the ATI, which causes issues in contact-rich tasks such as grasping.

I created a two-part CNC foam mold and used fiberglass, epoxy, and two-part expanding foam. With help applying the fiberglass from Ilia Lebedev and other friends. Lead shot was used to balance the rudder (as the foam was less than neutrally buoyant in water) and fiberglass blocks tacked to the outer shell were used to pre-stress the internal bronze skeleton (salvaged from the old rudder). What I did: CADing the original rudder, assisted excavation of original rudder, coming up with a plan for how to recreate the rudder, shopbot milling, large majority of composite layup by myself, assisted gel coating and fairing, assisted dremel work on installation of rudder The STL files may be found on Github.https://github.com/nouyang/scienceboat/blob/master/boatrudder.STL Mold halves were aligned with small pieces of PVC Outside three layers of glass applied.

Our class, “Introduction to Engineering,” was accompanied by a drawing robot arm of our own design, and raised over twenty thousand dollars on Kickstarter while reaching over ninety students around the world. We taught it on EdX with the permission of MIT’s Director of Digital Learning, Prof. Sanjay Sarma. We shipped ninety robotics kits on time and on-budget. Hanna Lin helped with the mechanical design and more over Summer 2013. We were accepted into the 2013 MIT Global Founders’ Skills Accelerator. By focusing on hands-on online learning, we sought to address flaws we saw in our own education, such as the tendency to rely on funding, teacher resources, and large teams not available in rural settings, as well as the focus on competitions that skewed heavily male.
